                            <p>BKT is currently undergoing the process of submitting the Tomorrow Water Project proposal to the UN. The proposal outlines all of the relevant information that are compulsory to the evaluation and decision-making process for the execution of TWP. With the principal objective of facilitating clean water through the global transformation of wastewater from cost stream to profit stream in mind, BKT hopes to attain all the necessary measures in soon time for the advancement of the implementation of the new process.

                                The Tomorrow Water Process seeks to minimize the global environmental impact of wastewater treatment while maximizing economic benefits through promoting local tourism, decreasing energy costs, and generating direct income sources in the form of carbon credits, which permit organizations a certain amount of carbon emission allowance, and advanced energy production. Initially focused on developing nations with warm-weather climates, the Tomorrow Water Initiative ultimately hopes to revolutionize wastewater treatment worldwide--encompassing a low-carbon-impact solution that reduces factors aggravating global climate change and facilitates preemptive measures to combat the consequences of natural disasters.</p>

                                        In the first stage, BKT will seek to formalize a site at which to construct and operate a test facility to serve as a demonstration hub. For maximum accessibility to future resources, collaborators, and international leaders, an ideal site would be located in a developed country with a tropical or temperate climate similar to that of developing nations but equipped with the additional economic and intellectual resources necessary to support simultaneous technological refinement. During this time, BKT will also solidify an advisory board of academic, political, and policy experts to streamline TWP’s technical details and validate its full capabilities—both for the developing world and for developed nations that can adopt some or all of the TWP technologies for energy savings and income generation during the wastewater treatment process.

                                Currently, limitations to the cutting-edge technological elements of the TWP require taking advantage of the warm temperatures inherent to the climates characteristic of many developing nations near the Equator. To reach its ultimate goal of establishing TWP as an industry standard to provide clean water all over the world, however, BKT must first pursue ongoing development of innovative technological solutions that lower cost and increase efficiency for each step of the TWP.

                                        For example, a key advantage of the TWP lies in the core biofiltration technology’s ability to divert carbon from the wastewater stream, maintaining the precise levels necessary to protect the necessary bacteria and algal processes downstream. Calibrated correctly, the interaction between these three distinct processes minimizes energy consumption while producing unprecedented water quality for reuse, simultaneously allowing the diverted carbon to be channeled for energy production through anaerobic digestion, which is the efficient breakdown of biodegradable material by microorganisms.

                                As it does today, BKT will join leading experts in various fields to encourage interdisciplinary discussion about and active collaboration for optimizing each individual component of the TWP and maximizing the efficiency of the overall process. The final goal is a “Net Zero” process that requires zero external energy consumption and zero chemical dosage, demanding significantly lower operating costs by reducing the energy costs, eliminating the chemical costs, and decreasing the sludge volume of traditional processes.
                            </p>

                                The minimal operating expenses in TWP’s cost structure makes it ideal for use in developing nations whose resources are heavily dependent on foreign and other external sources of aid. Furthermore, by using byproducts as nutrients for fertilization on farms producing flowers and other aesthetically pleasing inedible cash crops, TWP can transform unsightly municipal WWT facilities typically buried in low-income areas into beautiful facilities that enhance the community by doubling as tourist attractions, increasing quality of life and size of the labor force in the local population. These advantages will be crucial in winning the policy and fiscal support of local governments in facilitating community-based training and development to maximize the effectiveness of TWP facilities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Generation of new revenue streams through tourism, agriculture, and biogas or biomass production alongside salable carbon credits makes each TWP facility uniquely economically and environmentally self-sustaining. This decreased ongoing financial burden frees additional funds for resources to address inherent challenges in the design, construction, and operation of the TWP facility in developing nations—particularly for the education necessary to ensure a successful technology transfer process.
